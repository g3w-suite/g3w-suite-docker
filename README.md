This repository contains scripts and recipes for deploy of the G3W-SUITE web-gis application with Docker and Docker compose .

## Deploy

Follow steps to deploy G3W-SUITE on a Ubuntu Server (20.04)

### Configuration 

Create a file `.env` (or copy `.env.example` and rename it in `.env`) and place it in the main directory, the file
will contain the database credentials (change `<your password>`) and other settings:

```bash
# External hostname, for docker internal network aliases
WEBGIS_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=demo.g3wsuite.it/

# This volume is persistent and mounted by all
# containers as /shared-volume
WEBGIS_DOCKER_SHARED_VOLUME=/tmp/shared-volume-g3w-suite


# DB setup
G3WSUITE_POSTGRES_USER_LOCAL=g3wsuite
G3WSUITE_POSTGRES_PASS=<your_password>
G3WSUITE_POSTGRES_DBNAME=g3wsuite
G3WSUITE_POSTGRES_HOST=postgis
G3WSUITE_POSTGRES_PORT=5432


# QGIS Server env variables
# ----------------------------------------------------
PGSERVICEFILE=/pg_service/pg_service.conf
```

### Run

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

If all went well, G3W-SUITE run on http://localhost:8080

## G3W-SUITE with consumer image
G3W-SUITE use `huey` for bach processing (https://github.com/coleifer/huey), so if you want to use it,
use `docker-compose-consumer.yml` file on deploy:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-consumer.yml up -d
```

## Builds

Docker compose will download images from docker hub (https://hub.docker.com/u/g3wsuite), 
but is also possible build main image of G3W-SUITE and other docker-compose images. 

#### G3W-SUITE

The main suite docker image can be built with:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.g3wsuite.dockerfile -t g3wsuite/g3w-suite:dev --no-cache .
```

The image is build from `https://github.com/g3w-suite/g3w-admin.git --branch dev` and from a dependencies base image `Dockerfile.g3wsuite-deps.ltr.dockerfile`, the dependencies image can be built with:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.g3wsuite-deps.ltr.dockerfile -t g3wsuite/g3w-suite-deps-ltr:dev --no-cache .
```

Usually is sufficient make build of main docker image g3wsuite/g3w-suite:dev, 
the build of dependence image g3wsuite/g3w-suite-deps-ltr:dev is done to update last QGIS LTR version.

#### Postgis

Postgis image can be built with:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.postgis.dockerfile -t g3wsuite/postgis:11.0-2.5 .
```
The Docker hub name for this image is `g3wsuite/postgis:11.0-2.5`

## Setups

### PG_SERVICE

To use of PostgreSql Service, put your service setups into `./secrets/pg_service.conf file`,
the conf file will be mounted into docker container at runtime to PGSERVICEFILE path position.

### HTTPS additional setup

To active https with LetsEncrypt just follow the following instructions:

- uncomment ssl section within `config/nginx/django.conf.template`
- update `WEBGIS_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` environment variable within the `.env` file
- launch `sudo ./run_certbot.sh`
- restart compose: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d`
- make sure the certs are renewed by adding a cron job with `sudo crontab -e` and add the following line:
  `0 3 * * * /<path_to_your_docker_files>/run_certbot.sh`


### Volumes

Data, projects, uploads and the database are stored in a shared mounted volume `shared-volume`, the volume should be on a persistent storage device and a backup
policy must be enforced.

Currently, the volume is mounted in `/tmp/shared-volume-g3wsuite-dev`. In production
environments it is encouraged to change this to a permanent location.
This can be done by modifying the `.env` file.

### First time setup

- log into the application web administration panel using default credentials (_admin/admin_)
- change the password for the admin user and for any other example user that may be present

### Caching

Tile cache can be configured and cleared per-layer through the webgis admin panel and lasts forever until it is disabled or cleared.

> Tip: enable cache on linestring and polygon layers.

### Editing

Editing module is active by default, to avoid simultaneous feature editing by two or more users, the editing module works with a feature lock system.
This locking system can remain active if users do not exit the editing state correctly, to avoid this it is advisable to activate a cron job on host machine that checks the features that have been locked for more than 4 hours and frees them:

```
0 */1 * * * docker exec g3w-suite-docker_g3w-suite_1 python3 /code/g3w-admin/manage.py check_features_locked
```

## Front-end App

Set the environment variable
```
FRONTEND=True
```
This will set the front end app as the default app

## Style customization

Templates can now be overridden by placing the overrides in the `config/g3w-suite/overrides/templates`, a Docker service restart is required to make the changes effective.

The logo is also overridden (through `config/g3w-suite/settings_docker.py` which is mounted as a volume), changes to the settings file require the Docker service to be restarted.

A custom CSS is added to the pages, the file is located in `config/g3w-suite/overrides/static/style.css` and can be modified directly, changes are effective immediately.

## Performances optimization

General rules (in no particular order: they are all mandatory):

1. set scale-dependent visibility for the entire layer or for some filtered features (example: show only major roads until at scale 1:1E+6)
2. when using rule-based/categorized classification or scale-dependent visibility create indexes on the column(s) involved in the rule expression (example: "create index idx_elec_penwell_ious on elec_penwell_ious (owner);" )
3. start the project with only a few layers turned on by default
4. do not turn on by default base-layers XYZ such as (Google base maps)
5. do not use rule-based/categorized rendering on layers with too many categories (example: elec_penwell_public_power), they are unreadable anyway
6. enable redering simplification for not-point layers, set it to `Distance` `1.2` and check `Enable provider simplification if available`

## PostgreSQL administration

Postgres is running into a Docker container, in order to access the container, you can follow the instruction below:

### Check the container name

```bash
$ docker ps | grep postgis
84ef6a8d23e6        g3wsuite/postgis:11.0-2.5       "/bin/sh -c /docker-â€¦"   2 days ago          Up 2 days           0.0.0.0:5438->5432/tcp           g3wsuitedocker_postgis_1
```

In the above example the container name is `g3wsuitedocker_postgis_1`

### Log into the container

```bash
$ docker exec -it g3wsuitedocker_postgis_1 bash
```

### Become postgres user

```bash
root@84ef6a8d23e6:/# su - postgres
```

### Connect to postgis

```bash
postgres@84ef6a8d23e6:~$ psql
psql (11.2 (Debian 11.2-1.pgdg90+1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

## Portainer usage

Portainer (https://www.portainer.io) is a docker-based web application used to edit and manage Docker applications in a simple and intuitive way.

Plese refer to the [Add new stack](https://docs.portainer.io/v/ce-2.9/user/docker/stacks/add) section to learn how to deploy the `docker-compose-consumer.yml` stack with Portainer (>= v2.1.1).
